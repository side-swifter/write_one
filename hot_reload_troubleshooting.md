# Hot Reload Troubleshooting Guide

## üî• Issue: Changes not appearing in Android emulator

### ‚úÖ **SOLUTION FOUND**: App connection was lost

**Problem**: The Flutter app stopped running in the background, so hot reload wasn't working.

**Fix**: Restart the Flutter app with:
```bash
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

## Common Hot Reload Issues & Solutions

### 1. **App Not Running**
**Symptoms**: No changes appear, no hot reload messages
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Check if app is running
flutter devices
# Restart the app
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

### 2. **Connection Lost**
**Symptoms**: "Lost connection to device" message
**Solutions**:
- Restart the app: `flutter run`
- Check emulator is still running
- Try `flutter doctor` to check setup

### 3. **Hot Reload Not Triggering**
**Symptoms**: Changes made but no automatic reload
**Solutions**:
- **Manual hot reload**: Press `r` in the terminal where `flutter run` is active
- **Hot restart**: Press `R` to restart with state reset
- **Save file**: Make sure you save the file after making changes (Cmd+S / Ctrl+S)

### 4. **Syntax Errors**
**Symptoms**: Hot reload fails with error messages
**Solutions**:
- Fix syntax errors in your code
- Check for missing commas, brackets, or semicolons
- Use `flutter analyze` to check for issues

### 5. **Emulator Issues**
**Symptoms**: Emulator frozen or unresponsive
**Solutions**:
- Restart the Android emulator
- Try running on a different device: `flutter devices`
- Use `flutter run -d chrome` for web testing

## How to Verify Hot Reload is Working

### Step 1: Check App Status
Look for this in your terminal:
```
Flutter run key commands.
r Hot reload. üî•üî•üî•
R Hot restart.
```

### Step 2: Make a Simple Change
Try changing a color or text:
```dart
// Change this:
color: Colors.blue,
// To this:
color: Colors.red,
```

### Step 3: Save and Watch
- Save the file (Cmd+S)
- Look for hot reload message in terminal
- Check emulator for changes

## Manual Hot Reload Commands

In the terminal where `flutter run` is active:

- `r` - Hot reload (keeps app state)
- `R` - Hot restart (resets app state)  
- `h` - Show all commands
- `q` - Quit app
- `c` - Clear screen

## Best Practices for Hot Reload

### ‚úÖ **DO**
- Save files after making changes
- Use stateful widgets for dynamic content
- Make small, incremental changes
- Keep the terminal with `flutter run` visible

### ‚ùå **DON'T**
- Change the `main()` function (requires restart)
- Make too many changes at once
- Close the terminal running Flutter
- Ignore error messages
